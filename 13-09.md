**NBA**: Number of block accesses

**B**: Block size

**N**: Number of rows

**l**: row length

$l_{PI}$: length of primary index. Similarly, Secondary Index (SI), CI and SINk.

`l_k`: length of key

l_A: length of attribute

l_blockptr: Length of block pointer

**Blocking Factor (bfr)**: for row
and bfr for index

n_r / n_R: Number of blocks

### Consider example: Unordered File

```
bfr = floor(B / l)

n_R = ceil(N / bfr)
```

$\sigma_{K=val}(R)$ 
  - on average $n/2$
  - best 1
  - worst n

$\sigma_{A=i} (R) = \lceil \frac{c(A)_i}{bfr}\rceil$
  - $c(A)_i$: number of rows where $A = i$
  - worstcase `n`
  - average `n`
  - best 1 (only one block is accessed that contains all $c(A)_i$ rows).

## Ordered File

Worst case $log (n_R)$: for $\sigma_{k=val} (R)$.
  - Average case here is almost same as the worst case.
  - Best case: 1.


For $A$ attribute (assume ordered on $A$),

$log(n_R) + \lceil c(A)_i / bfr \rceil$

### Primary index

row of PI `K | blkptr`.

$N_{PI} = n_R$: Number of rows in the PI.

$l_{PI} = l_K + l_{blkptr}$

$bfr_{PI} = \lfloor(B / l_{PI}) \rfloor$

$n_{PI} = \lceil n_R / bfr \rceil$

NBA = log (n_PI) + 1 (one for accessing the block from the block pointer in the index)>

### Clustering Index

$l_c = l_A + l_{blkptr}$

$n_c = \lceil f_a / bfr_c \rceil$ where $f_a$ is the number of distinct values in $A$.

$NBA = log(n_c) + \lceil c(A)_i / bfr \rceil$

(**Assumption**: every new value starts in a new block in CI)


If we do $\sigma_{K= val} (R)$. clustering index won't optimize it and it will still remain as an unordered file case.


## Unordered File

### Secondary Index on Key Attribute

$l_{SK} = l_k + l_{rptr}$

bfr same as (`B/l` here $l = l_{SK}$).

Reason for using record pointer (so that I don't have to do linear search in the block. because that is very inefficient).

$n_{SK} = \lceil n / bfr \rceil$

$NBA_{SK} = \lceil log (n_{SK}) \rceil + 1$

### Secondary index on Non-key Attribute

$l_{SINK} = l_A + l_{blkptr}$

$bfr_{SINK} = \lfloor B / l_{SINK}\rfloor$

$n_{SINK} = \lceil f_a / bfr_{SINK} \rceil$.


$NBA = \lceil log (n_{SINK}) \rceil + \lceil \frac{c(A)_i}{\lfloor B / l_{recordptr} \rfloor} + c(A)_i$.

The second term corresponds to the indirection blocks
  - Meaning we take fraction of max correct rows by blocking factor for the indirection blocks
    - This gives the number of blocks that will contain the correct rows.

Then add max correct rows (in the worst case all the row pointers correspond to different blocks).

If $c(A)_i \sim n_R$. 
  - In the worst case each attribute is present in a different block
  - Then the SI is a waste and no better than sequential search. Example: Gender attribute in a table.

# B Tree (on key)

- p block pointers

$p * l_{blkptr} + (p - 1) * (l_k + l_{recpointer}) \leq B$

Calculate $p$ from this.

### B+ Tree
