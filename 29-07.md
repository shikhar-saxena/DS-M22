## Introduction

### Why use data(base) systems?

- **Persistent storage** (PS)
- reliability
- organizing complex data
- efficient access & update (includes concurrency)
- Security
- access friendly (for end user & dev)
- Scalable

Notion of *persistence* is very important.

### Storage devices

- HDD
- SDD
- Magnetic Tape
- Optical Disk

Last two are archival. First two widely used.

Organizing data in PS $\implies$ organizing data in data blocks (pages).

### Data System software

Needs to understand

- how data is organized
- how to process queries
- and all the good properties we discussed before.

First we'll discuss organizing data in PS then we'll discuss data system software then transaction management.

### DnA revisited

**Schema** describes the data using the data model.

- Conceptual Data model (ER)
- Relational Data Model

Way to go from one to another.

DBMS ensures **Constraints** (Implicit Relations) are satisfied.


#### Separation of semantic and domain values

`VARCHAR(40)` can be Name or description depending on semantics.

**Why is this separation interesting?**

Tradeoffs between Data Compression and Retrieval.
