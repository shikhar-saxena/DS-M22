## Indices that we've seen so far

- Key, block pointer
- Attribute value, block pointer
- Key, row pointer
- Attribute value, block pointer (that points to rows)

## Problem

- Index on a relation with $n_I$ blocks

Will take $log(n_I)$ to access.

How can we reduce this complexity even further?

**Create an index on index**

We can have an index on index on index (we go on till our index has just one block (like a tree)).Then access will take $log(B)$ where $B$ is block size for indices ???

But multilevel index is **very disadvantageous** for the case of updating the relation.

### Solution

- BST
  - Have the keys and pointers to $X < K_1$, $K_1 \leq X < K_2$, and so on uptil $X \geq K_p$.
  - This tree structure is very feasible.
  - We can decide on $p$.
  - Depending on $p$ the number of levels will change. $p$ increases, and the number of levels decreases. The less the number of levels, the better accessing the rows will be.
  - BST is not discussed much in the context of DS. But the takeaway is that there are a lot of choices that we can make.

# B-tree

- $K$ is key value
- $P_r$ is the pointer to the record
- $P_i$ is the pointer to the block (node)

$q$ pairs of $K_i$ and $P_{r_i}$.

Example:

```
P_1 -----------> X < K_1

P_r1 ----------> row in the block with key K_1

Similarly

P_2 -----------> K_1 < X < K_2
```

If we access $K_i$'s then it'll take instant access.
If we access some key value that is in-between the $q$ K values, then we'll have to look into the node that it is pointing to. and repeat the same steps again.

`q pointers` and `(q-1) K_i , P_r records`

```
q l_{block pointer} + (q - 1) ( l_k + l_{record pointer} ) <= B
q <= ... (solve)
```

DB people took $2/3$ of this value for $q$. (some space for updates and further insertions).

We design a multilevel index very judiciously.

Here the leaf nodes have null values.

# B+ tree

In B+ tree we fill up those empty null values in the B tree leaf nodes.

Here we say that we have two types of node
- Leaf node
  - Similar to a basic primary key index. Bunch of `(key, pointers)`. Then this leaf node connects to the next leaf node (optimization for some queries like `SELECT *`).
- Non-leaf node
  - Same as before

  you have to come to the leaf node (for accessing anything).

For leaf node:

```
q * (l_k + l_{record pointer}) + l_{block pointer} <= B
q <= solve * (2/3) 
```

For non-leaf node:

```
q * l_{block pointer} + (q - 1) * l_k <= B
q <= solve * (2/3)
```

|B tree| B+ tree|
|:--|:--|
|Data records exist at all levels of the tree|Data records exist at the leaf-level nodes|
|more levels|less levels (for the corresponding B tree)|
