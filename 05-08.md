# Class 3

Domain of values can be represented as 
- byte
- bitstream
- encoded

Attribute can have semantics of different kind.

TWO DIMENSIONS:

- Semantics
- Domain of values (DoV)

and the separation between them is a decision point. 

Since I know `age` cannot be beyond something, we can choose our representation accordingly.

## Storing a relation

$R(K, A_1, A_2, \ldots A_n)$

Let's look at a row $r_i$ of $R$.

Basically we are storing $DoV(K), DoV(A_1), \ldots Dov(A_n)$.

### Example

S(Rollno, CID, Grade)

How do we store these (rows) so that we can read them?

- Notion of separators 
  - between the attributes. More specifically, separation of DoV in a byte stream
  - issue to know where (one row) ends and another starts (sort of). Idea is fixed vs variable length. Example: Aadhar No vs Address. These are the cases that might cause issues.
- Length and value

**S(Rollno, CID, Grade)**

- 10 characters for Rollno
- 6 for CID
- 2 for Grade

This is very systematic. (Fixed Length rows). (Gotta reorganize if we add a new column)

**E(Eno,Dno, Salary, Ename, Address)**

We consider a Mixed Choice here.

Eno, Dno, Salary as one unit (fixed row).
Ename, Address as one unit (variable length).
  - Here we put employee `name ends` separator
  - After address we need a `row ends` separator

Accessing row values => `Part Math Part Skip till Separator`.


**E(Eno, Ename, Dno, Address, Salary)**

- Database might store attributes and consider mixed choice (one fixed unit and one variable unit) on its own.
- Assume this is the way we store somehow.
- Now we cannot use the fixed DoVs and we'll have to add separators for all.

We can not have separators for some fixed DoVs.


***Note: DoV is not always a fixed set. Example: you might as well put S for senior citizens in Age***


Attribute -> DoV + special Values

Sequence of attribute in a row 
-> Fixed (Math)
-> Mixed (Math + Separator)
-> Variable (All Separators)

## How to store a set of rows

<!--- Localized Pointers (can't have huge pointers cause data may be spread on different disks/different locations; so it's costly)-->

Fixed length space known as a *data block*

- Traditional / Classical Model

Try to fit as many rows in the data block

- Decomposition Storage Model

Divide the rows into sub parts. First parts in one block and Second parts in another Block. The attributes that are more accessed are stored together. Rest are stored in a different block. Also known as vertical partitioning.
So we replicate the key so that we can stitch back the row.

- Extreme form of decomposition

Store each attribute in a separate block. This is what is known as ***column store***.

There's one block with keys.

No need to replicate keys. Since the offset across all blocks (with the key block) is same. So we can use that.
