We defined $V(R,a)$ in the previous class.

Then each value repeats about $= n/V(R,a)$. But this assumes a uniform distribution.

|a|No. of rows|
|--|----------|
|a_1|k_1|
|a_2|k_2|
|...|...|
|a_k|k_k|


**Zipf Distribution**: 

$k_1 = k_1/\sqrt{1} = k_1$

$k_2 = k_1 / \sqrt{2}$

and so on.

There are queries to run statistics in most databases.

> Good statistics imply good query execution

Assume you have five relations $R_1 - R_5$ having $n_1 - n_5$ rows.

### Which join combination $R_i \Join R_j \Join R_k$ will have the least rows?

- **Top Down approach**: Consider estimation of $R_1 \Join R_2 \cdots \Join R_5$. This can be computed from the intermediate results of the sub trees i.e. partitions of $R_1 - R_5$. 
- **Bottom Up approach**: We start at the intermediate nodes and go upto the combination (in question).


**Push down approach**: The approach we saw before where Select and project are pushed down in the tree.


Let's say a tress has a cost $C$.

The database should spend more time in execution than in finding the optimal execution plan (since finding the optimal plan might be costlier than the query itself).


```
LEFT DEEP JOIN TREE

       Result
        |
       Join
       /  \
     Join  R_4
    /   \
  Join   R_3
 /    \
R_1    R_2    
```

|R(a,b)|S(b,c)|T(c,d)|U(d,a)|
|------|------|------|------|
|V(R,a) = 100|V(S,b) = 100|V(T,c) = 20|V(U,a) = 50|
|V(R,b) = 200|V(S,c) = 500|V(T,d) = 50|V(U,d) = 1000|

All have 1000 rows.

#### For $\{R\}, \{S\}, \{T\}, \{U\}$

- size = 1000 
- cost = 0
- best plan is `{Relation}`

#### For 2 combinations

We can find the size (from the estimation formula). Cost is still zero here.
Best plan is relation1 join relation2.

We prune $\{R, T\}$ and $\{S, U\}$ because these are simply cartesian products. And we will have to store 1000000 rows in intermediate result.

||RS|RT|RU|ST|SU|TU|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|size|5000|1000000|10000|2000|1000000|1000|
|discarded||Yes|||Yes||

### For 3 combinations

$(R \Join S) \Join T$ vs $R \Join (S \Join T)$.

||RST|RSU|RTU|STU|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|size|10000|50000|10000|2000|
|cost|2000|5000|1000|1000|
|best plan|(ST)R|(RS)U|(TU)R|(TU)S|

cost is min of rows of the intermediate result
