# Introduction to Transactions

Whenever system crashes, main memory is lost. Let's say we were inserting values (but now they won't be present in our stable storage.) System should know what to do during system crash.

It is evident that there is enough abundance (dearth) of transactions. So DBMS need to handle them well.

## Block management

Instead of reading the blocks from the disk again and again for each query. Instead we'll keep blocks in the main memory and queries might have common blocks that are shared. But this might lead to loss of information if system crashes (since stable storage is not updated).

- A simple solution is to do all the queries in an order (sequentially).`
