# How do you make sure a `QUERY` is correct?

```sql
SELECT * FROM E, D WHERE
E.Dno = D.Dno
AND Loc = "Hyd"
AND Salary < 50000;
```

There's a body that decides grammar for SQL. That is the standard to check if a `QUERY` is correct (after parsing the query and creating an abstract syntax tree).

# How is the `QUERY` executed?

After parsing we still do some sort of massaging for query optimization, etc.
The same execution methodology should work for all queries.

## How to represent an SQL Query?

**We can store the query as a data structure:** ***Tree***

### Relational Data Model

Gives assurance that whatever modification we do this data structure, after modification also; we'll get the same result.


```c
struct ds

ds' = f(ds) // Before this there is some drama tho
```

We can make an operatore tree for some computation and manipulate it.

## In relational databases, what will `ds` have?

We are blessed with relational algebra

```
        /
    SELECT(Salary > 50000)
      /
     E 
```

Number of equivalent trees explode with more relations. It's exponential in the size of relations.

**Problem: We can not optimize the tree**: No one has been able to come up with the solution for this.

### Execution Procedure

- If the query is syntactically and semantically correct, we create the parse tree.
- Then we'll bring it into another `query tree` form.

#### Query tree

Each node is a relation or an operation (on the relation).


## Join

$R \Join_\theta S = S \Join_\theta R$ will always hold.


Is $(R \Join_c S) \Join_{c'} T = R \Join_c (S \Join_{c'} T)$?

Example: `R(a,b) S(b,c) T(c,d)`

- Take $c := R.b > S.b$
- Take $c' = a < d$

## Select

- $\sigma_{c_1 \ and\ c_2} (R) = \sigma_{c_1}(\sigma_{c_2} (R))$
- $\sigma_{c_1 \ or\ c_2} (R) = \sigma_{c_1} (R) \cup \sigma_{c_2} (R)$
