# Data Blocks (continued)

Last row cannot properly fit then

- **Spanned allocation**: One row cuts in one data block and continues in the next block. (One row in two data blocks: some part in former, rest in latter).
- **Unspanned allocation**: space left blank in last block and next row in next block.

We rarely use spanned allocation.

## Difficulty with spanned allocation

Some extra metadata to store (to record offsets) about where the data blocks start now.

**Unspanned**: All rows start from offset 0. So it makes things easier.

## When is spanned important

when row size > DB size
offset varies a lot in such a case.

Often the case with read-only tables (with high variable attributes).

With fixed length attributes, unspanned will be better.

Most data blocks will have a bit vector (which maintains free space in the block). One single bit whether records exist or not (in a block) helps in inserting where space is available and so on.

Bit vector is easier to figure out + it is compressed also.

- Data Block (when stored in SSD).
- Page (when stored in Page).

## For variable length rows

Inside one data block,

We store metadata like

- location and length
- number of records

each location will point to the rows. 

So the next record that comes will be stored in free space with some offset.

Within block metadata that has the page organized.

There will be some contiguous free space also to save new records. (we want to save the effort of refragmentation).

## Other approach for variable-length record (didn't understand)

Basically a set of arrays pointing to the offsets??? Basically a cumulative sum of location of each record.

Rows are stored one after another in this approach. So we only need to store ze offsets.

In this approach we can jump offsets better (and small overhead).

For a relation you may need > 1 block to store records.
So more than 1 block should be treated as a single unit.


$R$ can be stored on one file or in (> 1) file. These files can be on different devices.

Now, we are bringing the idea of file

## Experiment

We insert $10000$ rows in a Relation $R$. What will happen?

- Drama in main memory
- My stable storage should have enough space to store these rows

Each file is given a fixed number of blocks.

First time insertion has no issue. No free space management needed.

But after let's say initial allocation is over (all 200 blocks are full).

Now we'll have to ask the DBMS to get more blocks (may have to ask the OS or it might say space over).


## File structure

## One Way

Header page -> filled blocks
            -> free blocks

### Another Way

metadata -> points to directories (index blocks) -> data blocks

Directories can contain the data block metadata example:
- number of records 
- free space

### Example

We store $1000000$ rows of employees.

Now how will `SELECT * FROM E where Eno=123456` work. 

(data already stored in blocks in some random order).

Solution:

- sequential scan: Going through every block to find the record. **Worst Case:** Record deleted or not found.

We can only sort one attribute. Then binary search.

Accesses: $\lceil log_2 (b)\rceil$ where $b$ is the number of blocks.
