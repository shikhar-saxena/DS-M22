If the query involves more than two tables, it becomes complex.

For indexing or accessing, sorting the data is very essential.

## Sorting the data

Bring the data into main memory then sort the blocks.
Known as external sorting because we are sorting blocks on the persistent storage (but for that we have to get $bfr$ blocks in the main memory and sort them there).

We have a buffer for let's say $l$ blocks in the main memory.

Bubble sort and Selection sort can be done but too painful ($n_r \times n$ comparisons).

**A way to sort:**

No way to omit any block in bubble or selection sort. But sorting each block then
merging them (sort-merge) might work in this case.


For $n_r$ (number of blocks) we need $2\times n_r$ blocks in main memory. Basic approach is to sort the blocks are write it back (to do operations on the blocks).

$n_b$ is the blocks available in the buffer.

- Bring first $n_b$ blocks.
- Sort them and write back to disk.
- Will have to do multiple iterations of this.
- $\lceil \frac{n_r}{n_b} \rceil$ iterations.
  - First iteration groups of $n_b$ blocks are sorted.
  - Second iteration we merge the groups of $n_b$ and $n_b$ blocks. ( $n_r/n_b^2$ sorted sets)
  - Third iteration we get $n_r/n_b^3$ sorted sets and so on.
  - Complexity $O(\lceil log_{n_b}(n_r) \rceil)$.

|||
|---|----|
|Sort and Write|$2\times n_r$|
|Each Run|$2\times n_r$|
|Number of Runs| $log_{n_b} (n_r)$|
|Total| $2\times n_r (1 + log_{n_b} (n_r))$|

## Project

- $\Pi_A (R)$ 
  - $n_r$ block accesses.
  - No way we can reduce this.
    - One way we can improve this is if we have an index on $A$.
    - `SELECT A FROM R` we still can't improve (because we have to read for each row).
    - `SELECT DISTINCT A FROM R` (we can improve if index on $A$).
    - `SELECT DISTINCT K, A FROM R` (we cannot really improve unless there's an index on $K$).

```sql
SELECT Dno
FROM E, D, P
WHERE E.Dno = D.Dno AND
D.Pno = P.Pno AND
D.Mno = E.Eno AND
Eno IN 
  (SELECT Eno FROM D WHERE
    (D.Dno = 'research' AND E.Dno = D.Dno)
  )
```


This query doesn't work even after we restrict the `Eno` for just employees doing `research`.

**Note:** Very important to not make assumptions and correlations on data (as many outliners might exist unless we specifically have metadata on the data that tells about these correlations). Also, making such assumptions is fine if it's a functional dependency in the data.

## Select

$\sigma_{\text{Dno = 4 or Dno = 5}} (E)$

$n_E$ blocks (for employee)

### Question: Can we avoid accessing all blocks or no?

If `Dno` is ordered we can optimize this query.

But let's say the condition is on both `Dno` and `salary` then we might have to access all blocks. So for all queries, we have very little leeway on optimizing our queries.

$\sigma_{((C_1 \land C_2 ) \land (C_3 \land C_4)) \lor C_5} (E)$

Difficulty with `OR`:
  - It is like cartesian product
  - It just explodes the number of rows in your result
  - For the above example, checking condition $C_5$ might be easy. but we also need to include the rows that satisfy the other condition which is more complex and will take more accesses to the data.

`AND` is easier
  - because all conditions should be satisfied
  - we are shrinking the number of rows $R(C_1 \land C_2) \subseteq R(C_1)$ or $\subseteq R(C_2)$.
  - `AND` decreases relation size so it's easier to compute.

$\sigma_{\text{Dno = 4 AND Salary > 50000}} (R)$
  - Indexing which attribute depends on DoVs. Let's say there's like 160 unique salary values. So number of blocks per unique value might be less compared to total $Dno$ values. Then we will prefer using Salary for our selection operation.
  - We can do better than this
    - We can use SINK (secondary index on non key attribute)
    - We have indices on both (Dno and Salary) now.
      - So take intersection of record pointers of both across the corresponding indices. We don't even have to access the rows till the last stage. We can just get the record pointers from the indirection blocks. And take intersection of the record pointers manipulation.

#### How to do intersection / union of two indirection blocks?

Say IDB (indirection blocks) for `salary > 50000` and `Dno =4`. (Both cannot fit in the main memory).

How to do intersection for the final result?

No choice but to access all blocks.
In the worst case we can hash the IDBs so as to eliminate them.
But otherwise it is a double loop.
`O(kl)` where `k` is no of IDBs for salary condition and `l` is no of IDBs for Dno condition.
If $k + l \le n_B$ we can do that in main memory itself. otherwise doomed.
