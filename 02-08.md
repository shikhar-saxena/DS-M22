## More on Relational Data Model

SQL queries abstract a lot of things making it ezier for app developers.
With XML / hierarchical data models, we need to know how the data is stored as well so as to access it.
With SQL, only the knowledge of schema is sufficient.

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee;
```

Don;t need to know where and how is `employee` data stored.

Mathematically (operations on Relational Data Model),

- Relational Algebra (used for query processing/optimization) *How I get it*
- Relational Calculus (led to SQL) *What I want*

Relational D.M. is advantageous because of the versatility in how and what.

## Relational Algebra (revisited)

- $\sigma_{c}$
- $\pi$
- $\Join$

```
SELECT attr_list
FROM table_list
WHERE (conditions)
GROUP BY (...)
HAVING <class>
ORDER BY (A) ASC/DESC;
```

except first two, all other statements are optional (from `where` to `order by`).

**SQL `where` clauses can be fairly complex. So, preparng the data system with appropriate storage and access algorithms, will optimize SQL.**

Idea of the course is what decisions we make in storing and accessing the data system.

## Storage

At the lowest level, domain values are what is stored.

Even this is pretty relavent and some database solutions optimize operations here.

Like converting from domain value to byte stream and vice versa.

Or data conversion from domain to another domain.

Also user defined datatypes.
