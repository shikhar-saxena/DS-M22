# Extendible Hashing

- No tree kind of structure.
- Directory in form of table.
- Directory contains hash value and pointer (to bucket).

We can start extendible hashing with let's say two bits. And change this number with collisions.

Example: taking first bit as hash value. Then increasing the first (n) bits with collisions.

We are using fewer pointers in extendible hashing.

## Local vs Global Depth

My directory structure is 3 bits. But for some bit representation I use only two bits.

Some buckets will use smaller bit representation which is *local depth*. And some might use complete bit representation which is *global depth*.
