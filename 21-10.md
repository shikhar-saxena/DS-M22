# On mysql startup

- An 'init' process for DBMS software
- It start some other processes like
  - Storage Manager (Finds the associated databases in the permanent storage and how to access them)
  - Buffer Manager
  - Relational Operator Executor
  - Another program might be having relations to file mapping 
  - etc.
- These take up a portion of the main memory
- Table catalogue also brought into main memory
- All of these programs are running concurrently

## So how does DBMS manage all of this?

- How does one thread access the same page? Will the page be read twice?
  - Ideally not.

We'll talk about the following:
  - DB Replacing OS Support
  - What is there for Disk data pages in Main Memory and its management?

While accessing blocks, care must be taken in their updation etc. If they get corrupted, we will lose our relation.


## Buffer Policies

### Pre-fetching

We can fetch the blocks of a relation before the query itself. The hints here are for example if we do nested join, or select on R, etc.

### Buffer is full

So we can't pre fetch anymore. What **replacement** policies we will use:

- **LRU**: Least Recently Used
  - This is the fallback option

Another implementation is using the **clock** algorithm. Or we can do **LRU(k)**: LRU for last $k$ pages.

### Buffer management for join query

$n_B$: Buffer pages available

query $q = R \Join S$ (Nested loop join)

- Store the result in only 1 page.
- 1 block for inner relation
- $n_B -2$ blocks for outer relation
