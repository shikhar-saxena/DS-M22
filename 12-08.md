# Class 4

Data types -> DoVs -> Row -> Data Block (page) -> File -> relation

- Floating point addition (can be not precise)
- real and decimal addition may give not consistent and non-precise (incorrect) answer.

**Solution**

Store as string.
Store the integer part, fraction, exponential part as a coded data structure (all as characters).

Then decode, operate, encode, etc.

Even date can be stored as a complex data structure. Accuracy & Precision important in regards to data systems.

## How do I store set of rows on persistent store?

$R(k, A_1, A_2 \cdots A_n)$

rows $r_1, r_2 \cdots r_n$.

Unit of storage and unit of access in persistent storages (HDD / Optical disk / SDD / etc.)

- Unit of storage is variable (user decided).
- Unit of access is hardware dependent (depending on the controller speed, etc. on the storage disk).
- Notion of address. It can also access things given their address. Therefore, it knows its layout and access logic.

Example:

Unit of access is 1K and unit of storage is 4K.
Upto DB designer to decide on these things.

- Provides you with some level of transparency at the code level.

`1 Block`: Unit of storage > access
`> 1 block`: unit of access > storage

- Data block (stable/persistant storage)
- data page (Main Memory)

## Page Design / Data Block Design

We will work with $2^k$ bytes (ez to access... $k$ bits needed).
Assume row size < block size.
We want to store $m$ rows.

How we store Depends on what all operations we perform on data block.

Most storage blocks will have a **header** (maybe a tail/footer also). Header can contain *file descriptors*, pointers, some control factors (bringing in main memory might toggle something).

If rows are fixed length, I can put that in the header (no need for separators between rows also).

### Rule of thumb to leave some space in the block. Why?

No. of blocks vs Insert/Update

We want to keep the number of blocks $\sim 1$.

That is why we leave some space for insertion (updation is no issue since fixed length rows).

For deletion, we might specify in header or put a separator at the end of previous row.

### Generic structure

Header and footer. Slots in the footer specifying the $i^{th}$ row offsets / base indices.
For example, we can store offsets to salaries in the slots.

If we delete something, we can delete its corresponding slot.

All this works if row size < DB size.

## Problem of clustering

Clustering is when a certain set of queries is run frequently on a set of records (20% of blocks accessed 80% of time).

This can be optimized to have minimal blocks to be read.

Data blocks -> File

a. We may have a relation stored in one file 
b. relation stored in multiple files 
c. multiple relations stored in one file (Very rarely multiple relations stored in a single file). `Select *` queries become difficult to manage with two or more relations in the same file.

**standard approach**: One Relation stored in one file

## How to store a file as a storage device?

- Contiguous
  Blocks contiguously connected till EOF
- Linked 
  File has a pointer that points to the first block that points the next block and so on.
- Index
  File has indices for each block that can be accessed.

### Why linked is a bad approach?

We don't know till where we have to go?
We don't know the number of blocks to traverse.

knowing that might help us in optimizing queries.

for `select * from R` 
- best: contiguous 
- worst: linked

Best `Index` for DB thingz.

Two ways of operating:
- Database has its own operations (the ones that are managed by OS). So OS doesn't need to be called for syscalls.
- Database uses OS calls for working on data.

THE END
