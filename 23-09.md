# Join Operation

Most common query:

```sql
SELECT A, B, C
FROM R, S
WHERE R.K = S.PK;
```

We have Blocks of R and S. We want to compute $R \Join S$. We can brute force and do cartesian product over $R$ and $S$. Then choose the attributes. The worst possible solution is two loops Over the rows of $R$ and $S$ respectively.

In order to guarantee the result we have no choice but to brute force the result

(Because if we want to eliminate a row we have to be sure that it's value is not present in any of the rows of the other relation).

## Brute Force Algorithm

```
b_r: All blocks of R
b_s: All blocks of S
r_i: One block from b_r
s_j: One block from b_s

for each block of R -> b_r
  for each block of S -> b_s
    take r_i from b_r
    take s_j from b_s
    if r_i.K = s_j.PK
      give result;
```

### Disadvantages

- Too many block accesses
  - I might bring irrelavent blocks that will not join with the corresponding rows (in a block) from the other relation.

### How to ensure that a join stops you from bringing $s_j$ if I know no row of $r_i$ will join with $s_j$?

Secondary Index on both tables might help in reducing block accesses.
Here tho, same block might be accessed more than once (if the same block has a different value later after accesssing it for some value). Thus sharing of blocks happens here.

This is known as *Index based Nested Loop JOIN (NLJ)*.

A **disadvantage** here is that in a block we might have values that are not same to the requisite value. And we are wasting comparing those records.

So sorting S (will be a good approach). We also sort R so as we don't have to access (the same value again)... values might repeat randomly in rows of R.

This apporach is known as *Sort-Merge Algorithm*. We can have clustering indices on both P and PK.

We rarely do JOIN operations (alone). Mostly we do `PROJECT(SELECT(JOIN))` operations. So we can optimize this (in a better way). Now, we can go directly to the value that we want and do join for that value only. Let's say we cannot do it this way tho.

So a better solution will be:

#### Hashing

Take the relation that has smaller number of blocks (and hash it).

We bring the blocks of other relation (in memory), hash the value and compare it (to check if the record is joinable). If yes, then we write it into the results block. This is known as *hash JOIN algorithm*. This is implemented in most modern database systems.

In the same bucket, we can have values (not equal to requisite value) but in this bucket because of same hash value. so we will have a overhead to check in the bucket if the value is same or not. (but still we restrict ourselves only to this bucket). This overhead is not present in Sort-merge algorithm.

##### An Idea: Compute the castesian product using join algorithms.

Partition the relation based on domain values. (Like 1-10, 10-20 etc.)

**Partition Join Algorithm**

```
Partition R into R_1, R_2, ..., R_m
Partition S into S_1, S_2, ..., R_m
(n_r and n_s rows)

Read: n_r + n_s 
+
Write: n_r + n_s
+
Join: n_r + n_s
+ 
n_result
```

If we have clustering index, it'll help in the query. Also, SI on non-key also helps because indirection blocks make partitions in data in itself.

In last step of partitioning there are some blocks in memory. Instead of calling a block again, we just use the ones in memory to partition again. Known as hybrid join.

Consider:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM R, S
WHERE R.K = S.PK;
```

and

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM R, S
WHERE R.K = S.PK;
```

### $R \cup S$

||||
|---|---|---|
|Worst way|Nested Loops||
|Better way|Sort $R$ and $S$. Then do pointer manipulation|But sorting is not cheaper. So use hashing.|

### Max Aggregation Query

```sql
SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee;
```

||||
|---|---|---|
|Brute force|Linear Search||
|Better way|Directly get from last value on the index|Assuming, there's an index on `salary`|

We can use secondary index directly (since it is dense). For primary index we have to add the number of rows (in the block) to get the result.

### Average Aggregation Query

```sql
SELECT Dno, Avg(Sal) From E GROUP BY Dno
```

Clustering Index will help. Each cluster's average can be found out ??

```sql
SELECT Avg(Sal) FROM E
```

Secondary index will help. We get to the redirection blocks. There we can count the number of pointers in the redirection block. This we can use to find the average for that particular value.
