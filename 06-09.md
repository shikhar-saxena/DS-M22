# Indexing (continued)

> Index is an ordered file

|| File is ordered | Unordered|
|----|---------------|:--------:|
|Key | Primary Index|... |
|Some other attribute| Clustering Index|...|

Unordered we will discuss today.

On some other attribute, redundant values can be there.

`Number of index blocks` = $\lfloor$ `block_size / length_of_index_rows`  $\rfloor$

### Disadvantage of Clustering Index

Painful to insert new values (if we create one as we did for primary index).

### Another organization (for clustering index)

All `1s` (value in the Domain) will start in a new block. All `2s` in new block and so on. Now we can insert easily.

**Ordering on large primary keys (like Aadhar number)**: The DBMS might internally create a spurious key and order the DB based on that.

## Secondary Index on key

Here, the data is unordered so we cannot make a primary index (with just the starting key value in each block as the index values).

So we'll utilize **secondary index**.

Index is sorted and points to the data blocks as `block pointer + offset`.

##### Dense index

`Number of index entries = Number of rows`

Always the case for indices on keys.

## Secondary index on a non-key attribute

each index node will have the `index_value` and the corresponding number of pointers to the data blocks.

Example. index on `5` can point to 4 blocks.

### Problem with this approach

Deleting is pain because the index nodes are variable length rows (which is pain).

Sequentially check through the pointers and update them (to delete rows) which is PAIN.

### Revised version

- Make index as `domain value` and `block pointer`.
- Each index value will point to new middle blocks.
- These middle blocks will have the `row_pointer = block pointer+offset` to the data blocks.

This is efficient for deletion as well (we can just remove the row pointer from the middle blocks).

Assignment

- Othello game
- at least 1000x1000 board
- 200 million or more games
- store configuration for each games
- Assume block size < board size
- Row size can be greater than block size

Design as such that you can replay the game (Go forward / backward).
